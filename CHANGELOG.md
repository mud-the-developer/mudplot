# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Colour engine**: sRGB ↔ linear ↔ XYZ ↔ Lab ↔ LCH conversions (numpy-only);
  CIE76/CIEDE2000 colour difference (validated against Sharma et al. 2005);
  Machado et al. (2009) colour-vision-deficiency simulation
  (protan/deutan/tritan); qualitative/sequential/diverging palette
  generators optimised for maximum contrast and CVD safety.
- **Declarative spec model**: `FigureSpec` and friends — a fully
  serialisable dataclass tree with lossless JSON round-tripping.
- **Pure reducer architecture**: `actions` + `reducer` + `store`
  (functional core / imperative shell); `Store.undo()`/`redo()`.
- **Renderer**: line/scatter/bar/errorbar/band/hline/vline/text/annotate/
  hist/box/heatmap layers; multi-panel layouts with width/height ratios;
  secondary y-axis; shared axes; despine; outside legends; continuous
  colour-mapped scatter + colorbar (using the same LCH colormaps).
- **Design-quality features**: redundant marker/line-style encoding for
  greyscale/CVD safety; palette `lightness_jitter`;
  `Palette.report()`/`grayscale_srgb()`.
- **TeX-aware WYSIWYG preview**: renders a figure at its true final size
  and font inside a mock document column (article/ieee/revtex/nature/acm
  presets).
- **Fluent builder API** (`mp.plot(...)`) accepting dict/records/rows/
  pandas/polars/numpy/pyarrow/DB-API cursor or connection+query inputs.
- **Agent-facing interface**: `capabilities()`, `json_schema()`, `apply()`,
  action history/replay (`action_log`), pure `validate()`/`assert_valid()`.
- **CLI**: `python -m mudplot {capabilities,schema,docs,validate,render}`.
- **Docs generation**: `mudplot.docs.reference_markdown()` — the same
  introspection that powers `capabilities()`, turned into a Markdown
  reference (`docs/REFERENCE.md`), kept in sync with CI.
- **Dashboard** (separate package, human-facing):
  - a static docs + design-gallery site generator
    (`python -m dashboard build`)
  - a local interactive editor prototype (`python -m dashboard serve`),
    driving the exact same Store/actions/reducer as the fluent API
- Packaging: `py.typed` marker, MIT `LICENSE`, English-first docs with
  Korean translations kept alongside (`*.ko.md`).

### Fixed (stability hardening pass)
- `.journal(...)` didn't actually change the figure size (a dead rcParams
  entry was shadowed by an explicit `figsize=`); now applied directly to
  the spec.
- Auto panel labels (a/b/c) used the theme's font size directly instead of
  the effective (possibly journal-overridden) rcParams value.
- The TeX `full_width=True` preview inflated the embedded figure to
  roughly 2x its true rendered size.
- `SetData` silently discarded previously-registered `data.matrices`.
- A flat list of strings passed as plotting data was shredded
  character-by-character instead of being rejected/treated as one column.
- `qualitative()`'s own `min_delta_e` reporting used an O(n²) pure-Python
  loop (impractically slow beyond a few hundred colours); requesting more
  colours than `n_candidates` silently produced duplicates.
- `Store(spec)` didn't defensively copy its initial state, so external
  mutations could leak into "pure" store state.
- The CLI printed raw Python tracebacks for ordinary errors (missing file,
  malformed JSON) instead of a clean one-line message.
- `hline`/`vline`/`text`/`annotate` ignored `axis="y2"` and always drew on
  the primary axis.
- Grouped bar charts drew every group at the same x position, hiding
  shorter bars behind taller ones; bars are now dodged automatically.

See `DESIGN.md` §4c2 and `tests/test_bugfixes.py` for full details on each
of the above.
